[Distributed RavenDB]: #distributed-ravendb

We've looked into RavenDB with an eye to finding out what it can do, but we've only just scratched the surface.
We've covered enough for you to be able to write simple CRUD applications, but there's a lot more we haven't covered yet. The 
chief topics we've yet to cover are the notions of running in a cluster and querying data.

I struggled to decide the order in which these two topics should show up in the book. Queries are _important_, but 
RavenDB is quite capable of handling a lot of the decisions around them on its own. And while queries and indexing can have a 
major impact on coding decisions, the distributed aspect of RavenDB should be a core part of the design of your 
architecture. For that reason, I decided to cover it first. If you only intend to run RavenDB as a single node, you can 
skip this part and go directly to the next, but I still recommend reading through it to understand what's available to you. 

Production deployments are always recommended to use a cluster, for high availability, fault tolerance and the load-balancing features that it brings to the table.

You might have noticed that the RavenDB philosophy is based on making things as obvious and easy to use as possible. Admittedly, working in a distributed environment is not a trivial task, given the challenges that you face as your
data start residing on multiple (sometimes disconnected) nodes, but RavenDB makes it easier than the vast majority of other 
distributed solutions.

The next chapter will first cover a bit of theory around the design of RavenDB. Then we'll set out to build a five-node cluster on your local machine and see what kind of tricks we can teach it. We'll finish with practical advice on how to best
use the distributed nature of RavenDB to your advantage. Following that, we'll dive deep into the innards of the 
distributed engine inside RavenDB. You'll learn how the sausage is made, and this knowledge can be very useful if you're 
troubleshooting.

Next, we'll talk about integrating RavenDB with the rest of your environment. RavenDB is rarely deployed on 
pure greenfield projects that don't have to talk to anything else. We'll discuss integration strategies with the rest
of your organization, ETL processes between different systems and how we mesh it all into a single whole.

The final topic in the "Distributed RavenDB" portion of this book will discuss various deployment topologies and how you 
should structure your cluster and your database in various environments. This is intended to serve as a set of blueprints 
for architects to start from when they begin building a system. with the rest
