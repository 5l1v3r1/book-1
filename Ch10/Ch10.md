## Static Indexes

In the previous chapter we looked at how we can query RavenDB and we mostly let the query optimizer to handle indexing things for us.
In the next chapter, we'll dive into the actual details about how indexes are implemented in RavenDB and the wealth of metrics into how 
indexes work and behave, which is very useful for performance monitoring and troubleshooting issues. This chapter, however, will discuss
primarily the how you can define your own indexes, why you would want to do that and what sort of options this provides you.

Indexes in RavenDB are split across multiple axes:

* Auto (dynamic) indexes vs. Static indexes.
* Map only indexes vs. Map/reduce indexes.
* Single collection indexes vs. Multi collection indexes. 

In addition to the types of indexes, they also offer quite a bit of features and capabilities, so it is a big topic to cover but also
one that give you tremendous amount of power and flexibility.


### What are indexes?

Indexes are how RavenDB can answer questions about your documents without contiously scanning the entire data set each and every time. 
An index can be created by the query optimizer or by the user directly. An index work by iterating over the documents and building a map 
between the terms that are indexed and the actual documents that contain them. After the first indexing run, the index will keep update
that map as updates and deletes happen on the database.

Listing 10.1 shows a very simple way to construct an index. The code in Listing 10.1 has nothing to do with RavenDB but is provided so
we'll have a baseline from which to discuss how indexes work.

```{caption="Creating an index over users' names" .cs}
Func<string, List<User>> BuildIndexOnUsers(List<User> users)
{
    var index = new Dictionary<string, List<int>>();
    for (var i = 0; i < users.Count; i++)
    {
        if (index.TryGetValue(users[i].Name, out var list) == false)
        {
            list = new List<int>();
            index[users[i].Name] = list;
        }
        list.Add(i);
    }

    return username =>
    {
        var results = new List<User>();
        if (index.TryGetValue(username, out var matches))
        {
            foreach (var match in matches)
                results.Add(users[match]);
        }
        return results;
    };
}
```

The code in Listing 10.1 is meant to convey the sense of what is going on. We are given a list of users, and we iterate over the list
building a dictionary that would allow fast access to user by name. This is all that an index is, effectively. It trade off the cost 
of building the index with significant reduction in the cost of the query. 

If there is a query that you only want to perform once, you are probably better off just scanning through the entire dataset, since that
is what creating an index will have to do anyway. But if you intend to query more than once, an index is a fine investment. Consider the 
two options shown in Listing 10.2.

```{caption="The right and wrong way to use an index" .cs}
// the right way
Func<string, List<User>> findUserByName = BuildIndexOnUsers(largeNumberOfUsers);
List<User> usersNamedOren = findUserByName("Oren");
List<User> usersNamedArava = findUserByName("Arava");

// the wrong way
List<User> usersNamedOren = BuildIndexOnUsers(largeNumberOfUsers)("Oren");
List<User> usersNamedArava = BuildIndexOnUsers(largeNumberOfUsers)("Arava");
```

In the first section in Listing 10.2, we generate the index and then use is multiple times. In the second section, we create the index 
for each query, dramatically increasing the overall cost of making the query.

The code in Listing 10.1 and Listing 10.2 is about as primitive an index as you can imagine. Real world indexes are quite a bit more
complex, but there is a surprising amount of details that are actually unchanged between the toy index we have here and real world 
indexes used in RavenDB.

Indexes in RavenDB are implemented via the Lucene search library, hosted inside Voron, the RavenDB's storage engine. An index in RavenDB
can contain multiple fields and a query can be composed of any number of clauses that operate on these fields. But in the end, we end up
with a simple search from the queried term to the list of documents that contain the term in the specified field, just like our 
dictionary usage in Listing 10.1.

#### Indexes come in layers, and with an identity crisis

I'll be the first to admit that it can be quite confusing, but RavenDB actually have several different things internally that are all 
called index. At the lowest level, we have Voron indexes, which is how RavenDB organize the data on persistent storage. As a user, you
don't have any control over Voron indexes. A Voron index is used to find a document by id, for example, or to return a list of documents
that belong to a particular collection, without any further filters. 

A Voron index is updated by the stroage engine directly as part of the transaction and is always kept in sync with the data. Unlike the 
async nature of higher level indexes in RavenDB, these indexes gurantee full consistency to the reader. They are also called storage 
indexes sometimes. You'll rarely be able to see them in use or affect them in any way, but they are crucial for the well being and 
performance of RavenDB.

I did mention that this is confusing, right? Because while we call these Voron indexes, our regular (exposed to the user) indexes are
also stored in Voron, but instead of being part of the storage engine, they are stored _inside_ the storage engine, to ensure that 
the index data is transactionally safe and can recover from an error such an abrupt shutdown.

Even for the user visible indexes (what you'll generally mean when you are talking about indexes) there are several different levels. 
At the outer edge of the system, you have the index that was defined for you by the query optimizer or manually created by you. This,
however, is not the actual index, but rather the index _definition_. It merely tell RavenDB how you want to index the data. 

Then, we have the actual process of indexing the data (which reside in the `Index` class and its derived classes) and the actual output
of the indexing process, which is also called an index. 

The good new about all of this naming mess is that you are very rarely going to need to think about any of that. As far as the outside
world can tell, RavenDB allow you to define indexes and that is pretty much it. But if you are reading the code or interested n the 
implementation details, you need to remember that when we are talking about an index, you might want to verify _what_ we are talking 
about. 

For this chapter, we'll use the term `index definition` for the definition of what is going to be indexed and the term `index` for the 
actual indexed data that is generated from the indexing process.

#### The first index

In the studio, go to the `Indexes` section and then to `List of Indexes`. Click on the `New index` button and give the index the name
"MyFirstIndex". This screen allows you to define an index by writing the transformation function from the document format to the 
actual indexed data. 

RavenDB uses C# and Linq to define indexes and Figure 10.1 shows the simplest possible index. Indexing the `FirstName` and `LastName`
from the `Employees` collection.

![A simple index over the `Employees` collection](./Ch10/img01.png)

An index is just a C# Linq expression on a collection that outputs the values that we want to index. The index in Figure 10.1 is not
a really interesting one and usually will not be a good candidate for a static index. There is nothing there that cannot be done 
using an auto index that the query optimizer will create for us. Nevertheless, let us see how we use such an index. 

Listing 10.3 shows how we can query this index. Instead of specifying that we'll use a collection, which will cause the query optimizer
to take over and select the best index to use, we are explicitly specifying that we want to use "MyFirstCollection" index.

```{caption="RQL query using an explicit index" .sql}
from index 'MyFirstIndex' where FirstName = 'Andrew'
```

Except for the explicit index, the rest of the query looks very familiar. Indeed, everything that we have gone over in the previous 
chapter still apply, the difference is that in this case, we have an index that define the shape of the result in a strict fashion.
That doesn't seem like such a good idea, until you realize that the shape of the index and the shape of the source document does not
have to be the same. Consider Listing 10.4, which shows an updated definition for "MyFirstIndex" which index a computed value rather
than the actual values on the document and Listing 10.5, which shows how to query the new index.


```{caption="Indexing a computation allow us to query over the computed value" .cs}
from emp in docs.Employees
select new 
{
    Name = emp.FirstName + " " + emp.LastName
}
```

```{caption="Querying over the computed field" .sql}
from index 'MyFirstIndex' where Name = "Nancy Davolio"
```

The result of Listing 10.4 and Listing 10.5 is quite interesting, so it is worth examining further. In Listing 10.4 we define an index
whose output is a computed field which is the result of a concatenation of two values. In Listing 10.5 you can see that we are querying
over the index and finding a result, even though the source document never contained such a field. 

The example here is quite silly, I'll be the first to admit, but it show off nicely a very important feature. You can run computation 
during the indexing process, and they query over the result of said computation. This is quite powerful, because it allows you to 
do some pretty cool things. For example, consider Listing 10.6 which shows an index ("Orders/Total" in the sample data set) that does
a more interesting computation.

```{caption="Computation during indexing can be arbitrarily complex" .cs}
from order in docs.Orders
select new { 
    order.Employee,  
    order.Company, 
    Total = order.Lines.Sum(l=>(l.Quantity * l.PricePerUnit) *  ( 1 - l.Discount)) 
}
```

In Listing 10.6 we can see that we compute the total value of an order. The formula we use is not too complex, but it is also not 
trivial. What makes this interesting is that this allow us to run a query such as the one in Listing 10.7.


```{caption="Querying over computed field as well as sorting by it" .cs}
from index 'Orders/Totals'
where Total > 100
order by Total as double desc
```

The query in Listing 10.7 is an important example because it demonstrate a few key concepts. Once the indexing process is done, the 
computed field is just a field. It means that you can filter using this field as well as sort by it. The computation has already 
happened at indexing time, and the cost of the query in Listing 10.7 is an index seek to the relevant location in the index and then 
sorting the results according to the indexed value.

Most importantly, this query involves _no_ computation during its execution, only index operations. In contrast to a comparable query
in SQL, which would have to sum all of the order lines for each of `Orders` table, we can take an enormous shortcut by
running the computation once during indexing and reusing it in our queries. 
We are going to spend quite some time exploring what kind of fun we can have with this feature.

Doing computation during indexing is a neat trick, but how does RavenDB handle the case where a document was updated? That is quite 
simple, as it turns out. All RavenDB needs to do is to simply run the udpated document through the indexing function again and index
the resulting values. 

#### How the index actually works

There are a lot of moving parts here, so we need to clearly define what the terms we use mean:

* Document - the RavenDB JSON document.
* Index entry - all of fields and values that has been indexed from a particular document. Frequently it will be a subset
  of the fields from the document that is being indexed, but it can be some computed fields as well.
* Term - the actual indexed value that is stored in the index. This is usually the same as the value of the field being
  indexed, but it can be different if you are applying full text search.

For example, let us assume that we have the JSON document in Listing 10.8 and we query using `from Docs where search(Name, 'Arava')`. 

```{caption="Sample document that is about to be indexed" .json}
{
	'Name': 'Arava Eini', 
	'Nick': 'Dawg', 
	'@metadata': {
		'@id': 'dogs/1',
        '@collection': 'Dogs'
	} 
}
```
What will happen happen is that RavenDB will produce an index entry from this document that
will have the following structure: `{'Name': 'Arava Eini'}` and mark the `Name` field as using full text search. This require
additional processing and the actual terms that will be indexed are shown in Listing 10.9.
 	
```{caption="Index terms after the analyzing for full text search" .json}
index = {	
	'Name': {
		'arava': ['dogs/1'],
		'eini': ['dogs/1']
	}
}
```

The `search(Name, 'Arava')` will be then be translated into what is effectively an search on: `index.Name['arava']` to get the proper
matches. 

This isn't how the index work _at all_. But it is a very good lie, because it allows you to reason about what is going on and make intuative
guesses about the behavior of the system without actually having to deal with the full complexity of managing an index. For example, you can 
see from the data we keep in the index in Listing 10.9 that we aren't storing the full document in the index, instead, we only store the 
document id.

This means that the query pipeline first need to run the query on the index and get the list of document ids that are a match for this query 
and then go to the documents storage to load the actual documents from there.

> One of the promises that RavenDB provides is that document reading is always ACID and must be consistent (within a single node, at least).
> That means that even if the index itself hasn't caught up to changes, the data it pull from the document store will have everything up to date.

Another important aspect of how queries work in RavenDB that you can see in Listing 10.9 is that the `Name` field was not indexed as a single 
term. In other words, if we would look for `index.Name['Arava Eini']`, we'll not find anything in the index. This is because we search on the
terms on the index. And during indexing, we broke the name to its constituents parts and lower cased it. At query time, we can apply the same
transformation and be able to find the individual terms.

If we were indexing the name _without_ full text search, we would index the term `arava eini`. So the only thing this will allow is to query
using case insensitive manner. Using `exact()`, of course, will store the term in the index as is and will require a case sensitive match.

We already saw, in Figure 9.4 in the previous chapter, that you can pull the terms that are actualled indexed from RavenDB and inspect them, 
which can help you understand why your queries return the results they do. 

All of this explanation is here to hammer home the fact that at the index level, we aren't querying on your documents' properties, we are 
querying on the output of the indexing function, and that may bear little resemblence to how you index looks like, the `Total` field in 
Listing 10.6 serve as a good example for this feature. The documents do not have a `Total` property, but we can compute it during indexing
and query on it.

We can also _filter_ data out during indexing. The indexing function takes a collection of documents and return a collection of index 
entries. It can also return _no_ index entries, in which case the document will not be indexed. This can be done using a `where` in the 
Linq express that compose the index definition. Listing 10.10 shows an example of filtering out employees without a manager for the
"Employees/ByManager" index^[The general recommendation is that you'll have a single index per collection with all the fields that you 
want to search on defined on that index. It is better to have fewer and bigger indexes than smaller and more indexes.].

```{caption="Filtering documents during indexing" .cs}
from employee in docs.Employees
where employee.ReportsTo != null
select new
{
    employee.ReportsTo
}
```

Only employees who has someone to report to will be included in this index. There isn't usually a good reason to filter things during
the indexing process, the reduction in the index data size isn't meaningful and you'll usually better to have this in the query itself
where you can make such decisions on a per query basis. We'll see another usecase for filtering the raw data to the index in a bit, when
we'll dicuss mutli map indexes.

#### Storing data in the index

A query in RavenDB will go to the index to find the results (and the order in which to return them) and then usually grab the document ids
from the results and load them from the document store. Since the typical query will return full documents back, that is usually what you'll 
want to do.

Sometimes, such as with the `Total` field in Listing 10.6, you want to compute a value during indexing and use it in your projection. By 
default, RavenDB will store in the index only enoguh information to handle the query, and not to get data out of the index. So as it stands,
we'll need to recompute the `Total` after the query. 

We can ask RavenDB to store the field. Go to "Indexes" and then "List of Indexes" and clikc on "Orders/Totals" index. Thie will take you to 
the index edit screen, click on "Add Field" and then set `Total` as the field name and set "Store" to `Yes`. You can now save the index.
This setting tells RavenDB that it need to store the value itself (and not just the parts that it indexed) in such as way that we can later
retrieve it.

We can project the `Total` field from the query, as you can see in Listing 10.11.

```{caption="Projection of a stored computed field from " .sql}
from index 'Orders/Totals'
where Total > 10.0
select Total, Company, OrderedAt
```

Listing 10.11 also shows that we can project a standard field, `Compnay`, without storing it. This works because if the value isn't stored in the index
we'll try to get it from the document. Last, we also project the `OrderedAt`, which follow the same logic. It isn't stored in the index, so it is 
fetched directly from the document. 

Stored fields are used primarily to store the result of such computations, but there is a small perfromance advantage in projecting everything
from the index. We don't need to do the document load, and in some very specific circumstances, that might be helpful. Document load is a _very_ 
cheap process in RavenDB. It happens so frequently it has been heavily optimized, so there is usually not much point trying to store fields in the 
index for that reason.

Storing data in the index will also increase its size and the time it take to actually index, since it needs to do more work. Unless you actually need
to get the projection out, it is usually not worth it.

### Querying many source at once with Mutli Map indexes

Sometimes, just querying a single source is not enough. In the sample database, we have several types of users. We have `Employees`, the `Contact`
person on `Companies` and the `Contact` person for `Suppliers`. If an application needed to allow a free form search over all of these users, how
would that work? Will we need to perform three separate queries? We _could_ do that, but that would be pretty complex. Instead, we can define an 
index that will use more than a single source of data. 

Go to `Indexes` and then to `List of Indexes` and click on `New Index`. Name the new index "People/Search" and click on `Add map` twice. You can
see the content of the map functions in Liting 10.12.

```{caption="These map functions allow us to query over multiple sources with ease" .cs}
from e in docs.Employees
select new
{
    Name = e.FirstName + " " + e.LastName
}

from c in docs.Companies
select new 
{
    c.Contact.Name
}

from s in docs.Suppliers
select new 
{
    s.Contact.Name
}
```

The three map functions in Listing 10.12 each points to a different collection. RavenDB will use the information from all three map functions to 
generate a single index. This means that you can now query on all of these collections as a single unit. There are a few things to notice, though.
First, multi map indexes require that all the maps in the index will have the same output. Note that we indexed a `Name` field in all three maps
even though the `Employees` collection have no such field. 

The other important factor is that it is usually awkward to have to deal with heterogeneous result set. When you are querying, it is often really
nice to know what shape of data to expect. A query on a multi map can return any of the collections that the multi map index covers. Because of 
that, it is usually best to project the data out into a common shape, as you can see in Listing 10.13.

```{caption="Projecting data from multiple collections into a common shape" .sql}
from index 'People/Search' as p 
where Name in ('Mary Saveley', 'Nancy Davolio', 'Wendy Mackenzie')
select
{
    Collection: p["@metadata"]["@collection"],
    ContactName: (p.Contact || { Name: p.FirstName + " " + p.LastName }).Name
}
```

The output of the query in Listing 10.13 can be seen in Figure 10.2. You can also remove the `select` clause for this query to see how the query
results will change when you get three different types of documents back from a single query.

![Common output shape for results from mutli map index](./Ch10/img01.png)

In a way, the multi map feature is similar to a union in relational database. It allows you to query over multiple source and get the results back
from any of them. However, there is no limit on the shape of the results like there would be with a union, although that is quite convenient. 

### Full text indexes

The query in Listing 10.13 is nice, but it awkward, we wouldn't want to ask our users to specify the full name of the person that they are trying to 
find, we'll typically want to do a smarter search. A... full text search, one might even ask.

In the previous chapter we looked at some full text search queries. They look like `search(Name, 'Nancy')` and allowed us to efficeintly search for
results without the expense of scanning all of them. Listing 10.9 is a good example of how RavenDB breaks up the terms during indexing for quick 
lookups and speedy searches. But so far we only looked at it as dynamic queries. How do I make use of the
