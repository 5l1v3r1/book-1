## Static Indexes

In the previous chapter we looked at how we can query RavenDB and we mostly let the query optimizer to handle indexing things for us.
In the next chapter, we'll dive into the actual details about how indexes are implemented in RavenDB and the wealth of metrics into how 
indexes work and behave, which is very useful for performance monitoring and troubleshooting issues. This chapter, however, will discuss
primarily the how you can define your own indexes, why you would want to do that and what sort of options this provides you.

Indexed in RavenDB are split across multiple axes:

* Auto (dynamic) indexes vs. Static indexes.
* Map only indexes vs. Map/reduce indexes.
* Single collection indexes vs. Multi collection indexes. 

In addition to the types of indexes, they also offer quite a bit of features and capabilities, so it is a big topic to cover but also
one that give you tremendous amount of power and flexibility. 


### What are indexes?

Indexes are how RavenDB can answer questions about your documents without contiously scanning over them. An index can be created by
the query optimizer or by the user directly. An index work by scanning over the documents and building a map between the terms that
are indexed and the actual documents that contain them. 

Listing 10.1 shows a very simple way to construct an index. The code in Listing 10.1 has nothing to do with RavenDB but is provided so
we'll have a baseline from which to discuss how indexes work.

```{caption="Creating an index over users' names" .cs}
Func<string, List<User>> BuildIndexOnUsers(List<User> users)
{
    var index = new Dictionary<string, List<int>>();
    for (var i = 0; i < users.Count; i++)
    {
        if (index.TryGetValue(users[i].Name, out var list) == false)
        {
            list = new List<int>();
            index[users[i].Name] = list;
        }
        list.Add(i);
    }

    return username =>
    {
        var results = new List<User>();
        if (index.TryGetValue(username, out var matches))
        {
            foreach (var match in matches)
                results.Add(users[match]);
        }
        return results;
    };
}
```

The code in Listing 10.1 is meant to convey the sense of what is going on. We are given a list of users, and we iterate over the list
building a dictionary that would allow fast access to user by name. This is all that an index is, effectively. It trade off the cost 
of building the index with significant reduction in the cost of the query. 

If there is a query that you only want to perform once, you are probably better off just scanning through the entire dataset, since that
is what creating an index will have to do anyway. But if you intend to query more than once, an index is a fine investment. Consider the 
two options shown in Listing 10.2.

```{caption="The right and wrong way to use an index" .cs}
// the right way
Func<string, List<User>> findUserByName = BuildIndexOnUsers(largeNumberOfUsers);
List<User> usersNamedOren = findUserByName("Oren");
List<User> usersNamedArava = findUserByName("Arava");

// the wrong way
List<User> usersNamedOren = BuildIndexOnUsers(largeNumberOfUsers)("Oren");
List<User> usersNamedArava = BuildIndexOnUsers(largeNumberOfUsers)("Arava");
```

In the first section in Listing 10.2, we generate the index and then use is multiple times. In the second section, we create the index 
for each query, dramatically increasing the overall cost of making the query.

The code in Listing 10.1 and Listing 10.2 is about as primitive an index as you can imagine. Real world indexes are quite a bit more
complex, but there is a surprising amount of details that are actually unchanged between the toy index we have here and real world 
indexes used in RavenDB.

Indexes in RavenDB are implemented via the Lucene search library, hosted inside Voron, the RavenDB's storage engine. An index in RavenDB
can contain multiple fields and a query can be composed of any number of clauses that operate on these fields. But in the end, we end up
with a simple search from the queried term to the list of documents that contain the term in the specified field, just like our 
dictionary usage in Listing 10.1.

#### Indexes come in layers, and with an identity crisis

I'll be the first to admit that it can be quite confusing, but RavenDB actually have several different things internally that are all 
called index. At the lowest level, we have Voron indexes, which is how RavenDB organize the data on persistent storage. As a user, you
don't have any control over Voron indexes. A Voron index is used to find a document by id, for example, or to return a list of documents
that belong to a particular collection, without any further filters. 

A Voron index is updated by the stroage engine directly as part of the transaction and is always kept in sync with the data. Unlike the 
async nature of higher level indexes in RavenDB, these indexes gurantee full consistency to the reader. They are also called storage 
indexes sometimes. You'll rarely be able to see them in use or affect them in any way, but they are crucial for the well being and 
performance of RavenDB.

I did mention that this is confusing, right? Because while we call these Voron indexes, our regular (exposed to the user) indexes are
also stored in Voron, but instead of being part of the storage engine, they are stored _inside_ the storage engine, to ensure that 
the index data is transactionally safe and can recover from an error such an abrupt shutdown.

Even for the user visible indexes (what you'll generally mean when you are talking about indexes) there are several different levels. 
At the outer edge of the system, you have the index that was defined for you by the query optimizer or manually created by you. This,
however, is not the actual index, but rather the index _definition_. It merely tell RavenDB how you want to index the data. 

Then, we have the actual process of indexing the data (which reside in the `Index` class and its derived classes) and the actual output
of the indexing process, which is also called an index. 

The good new about all of this naming mess is that you are very rarely going to need to think about any of that. As far as the outside
world can tell, RavenDB allow you to define indexes and that is pretty much it. But if you are reading the code or interested n the 
implementation details, you need to remember that when we are talking about an index, you might want to verify _what_ we are talking 
about. 

For this chapter, we'll use the term `index definition` for the definition of what is going to be indexed and the term `index` for the 
actual indexed data that is generated from the indexing process.

#### Our first index

In the studio, go to the `Indexes` section and then to `List of Indexes`. Click on the `New index` button and give the index the name
"MyFirstIndex". This screen allow syou to define an index by writing the transformation function from the document format to the 
actual indexed data. 

RavenDB uses C# and Linq to define indexes and Figure 10.1 shows the simplest possible index. Indexing the `FirstName` and `LastName`
from the `Employees` collection.

![A simple index over the `Employees` collection](./Ch10/img01.png)

An index is just a C# Linq expression on a collection that outputs the values that we want to index. The index in Figure 10.1 is not
a really interesting one and usually will not be a good candidate for a static index. There is nothing there that cannot be done 
using an auto index that the query optimizer will create for us. Nevertheless, let us see how we use such an index. 

Listing 10.3 shows how we can query this index. Instead of specifying that we'll use a collection, which will cause the query optimizer
to take over and select the best index to use, we are explicitly specifying that we want to use "MyFirstCollection" index.

```{caption="RQL query using an explicit index" .sql}
from index 'MyFirstIndex' where FirstName = 'Andrew'
```

Except for the explicit index, the rest of the query looks very familiar. Indeed, everything that we have gone over in the previous 
chapter still apply, the difference is that in this case, we have an index that define the shape of the result in a strict fashion.
That doesn't seem like such a good idea, until you realize that the shape of the index and the shape of the source document does not
have to be the same. Consider Listing 10.4, which shows an updated definition for "MyFirstIndex" which index a computed value rather
than the actual values on the document and Listing 10.5, which shows how to query the new index.


```{caption="Indexing a computation allow us to query over the computed value" .cs}
from emp in docs.Employees
select new 
{
    Name = emp.FirstName + " " + emp.LastName
}
```

```{caption="Querying over the computed field" .sql}
from index 'MyFirstIndex' where Name = "Nancy Davolio"
```

The result of Listing 10.4 and Listing 10.5 is quite interesting, so it is worth examining further. In Listing 10.4 we define an index
whose output is a computed field which is the result of a concatenation of two values. In Listing 10.5 you can see that we are querying
over the index and finding a result, even though the source document never contained such a field. 

The example here is quite silly, I'll be the first to admit, but it show off nicely a very important feature. You can run computation 
during the indexing process, and they query over the result of said computation. This is quite powerful, because it allows you to 
do some pretty cool things. For example, consider Listing 10.6 which shows an index ("Orders/Total" in the sample data set) that does
a more interesting computation.

```{caption="Computation during indexing can be arbitrarily complex" .cs}
from order in docs.Orders
select new { 
    order.Employee,  
    order.Company, 
    Total = order.Lines.Sum(l=>(l.Quantity * l.PricePerUnit) *  ( 1 - l.Discount)) 
}
```

In Listing 10.6 we can see that we compute the total value of an order. The formula we use is not too complex, but it is also not 
trivial. What makes this interesting is that this allow us to run a query such as the one in Listing 10.7.


```{caption="Querying over computed field as well as sorting by it" .cs}
from index 'Orders/Totals'
where Total > 100
order by Total as double desc
```

The query in Listing 10.7 is an important example because it demonstrate a few key concepts. Once the indexing process is done, the 
computed field is just a field. It means that you can filter using this field as well as sort by it. The computation has already 
happened at indexing time, and the cost of the query in Listing 10.7 is an index seek to the relevant location in the index and then 
sorting the results according to the indexed value. 

Most importantly, this query involves _no_ computation during its execution, only index operations. In contrast to a comparable query
in SQL, which would have to sum all of the order lines for each of `Orders` table, we can take an enormous shortcut by
running the computation once during indexing and reusing it in our queries. 
We are going to spend quite some time exploring what kind of fun we can have with this feature.

Doing computation during indexing is a neat trick, but how does RavenDB handle the case where a document was updated? That is quite 
simple, as it turns out. All RavenDB needs to do is to simply run the udpated document through the indexing function again and index
the resulting values.
