Map/Reduce is a programming concept that was made popular after Google started talking about doing their Page Rank algorithm using it. The idea isn't new, but the scale in which Google applied it was.

You've probably heard about Map/Reduce in the past, at least in passing. But my experience have shown that this is a subject most people have marked with "There Be Dragons" in their head and consider this something that is only relevant for Big Data or special use cases.

The terminology used is a strong part of that. The terms Map/Reduce actually refer to function name in Lisp and to a common usage pattern in functional languages. All of which result in even technical people assuming that this is nerd stuff that they don't need to care about.

Another way to talk about Map/Reduce is to talk about aggregation. In particular, aggregation of a data set to a smaller summary. I assume that you are familiar with SQL, so you shouldn't have a problem understanding the SQL statement in Listing 10.1.

```{caption="{Aggregation using GROUP BY in SQL}" .sql}
SELECT o.CustomerID, SUM(ol.Quantity * ol.UnitPrice) TotalPurchases 
FROM Orders o 
	JOIN [Order Details] ol ON o.OrderID = ol.OrderID
GROUP BY o.CustomerID
```
If you aren't familiar with SQL, don't worry. What this statement is doing is to get the total amount of all purchases for each customer. Nothing surprising or scary about this, right?

The statement in Listing 10.1 is something that most developers encounter on a regular basis. We are just doing a bit of aggregation, nothing as fancy or hard as Map/Reduce. But the interesting thing about Map/Reduce is that it is best when it is doing exactly what Listing 10.1 is doing. Aggregation over a data source to get the summary. In Listing 10.2, I translated the SQL into a Linq statement.

```{caption="{Aggregation using GroupBy in Linq}" .cs}
var q = from o in orders
		group o by o.CustomerId into g
		select new 
		{
			CustomerId = g.Key,
			TotalPurchases = g.Sum(x=>x.Quantity * x.UnitPrice)
		}
	}
```
