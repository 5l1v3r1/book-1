#  RavenDB, The back story

In Sep 2007, I was sitting in JAOO, listening to [Joe Armstrong](http://joearms.github.io/) talk about Erlang, distributed systems and 9 nines reliability. 
Afterward, I bought his [Programming Erlang](http://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang) book and read it cover to cover. 
I thought the ideas presented in both the talk and the book were facinating, but just _reading_ about them in a book wasn't enough. Armed with just enough knowledge about Erlang to be able to sort of understand what it does, I decided that I need something bigger.
