RavenDB indexes are based on top of the Lucene search engine library. Lucene was created specifically to allow to do fast searches on large amount of data using advanced Information Retreival techniques. Colloquially, this is usually called Full Search Text.

It probably wouldn't surprise you that RavenDB is really good at that. Mostly because of the use of Lucene, but also because RavenDB does a whole _lot_ of work behind the scenes to get everything just right. We already discussed in detail all the process leading up to the actual indexing stage. In this chapter, we'll discuss the behavior of Lucene and how RavenDB is using it, as well as explain how you can take advantage of this information in your own systems.

Note that this isn't meant to be an exhaustive discussion of Lucene itself. The book [Lucene in Action](http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/) is a great resource for that, and something that we have made use of during the development of RavenDB.

## Inverted Index

The major problem with full text search is that computers are pretty bad at it. A computer can look at sorted data very quickly, but doing free form searches is quite beyond them.
