## Querying with RavenDB

[Querying]:(#queries)

Queries in RavenDB are using a SQL-like language called^[Aren't you surprised?] RavenDB Query Language, henceforth known as RQL^[Pronounced
Rachel, like my wife and because it is funny.]. 

You already run into the RavenDB Query Language before, even if I didn't explicitly called it out as such, when using subscriptions. Both
subscriptions and queries are using RQL, although there are a few differences between the supported options between the two. The idea with 
RQL is to expose directly the inner working of the RavenDB query pipeline in a way that isn't going to overwhelme users.

Therefor, we'll first take a brief look at how RavenDB is actually processing queries, then get started on actually running queries. We'll
start from the simplest scenarios and explore all the nooks and cranies of what you can do with RavenDB queries.

### The query pipeline

When a RavenDB instance gets a query, the very first thing that happens is that the query optimizer analyzes it. The role of the query
optimizier is to determine what indexes should be used by this particular query. This is pretty much par the course for databases. However,
with RavenDB, there are two types of queries. You may have a dynamic query, such as `from Orders where ...`, which give the query optimizer
full freedom with regards to which index that query will use. Alternatively, a query can specify a specific index to be used, such as: 
`from index "Orders/ByCompany" where ...`, which instructs RavenDB to use the `Orders/ByCompany` index.
