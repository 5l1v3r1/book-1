We have a running instance of RavenDB, and we have already seen how we can put and get information out of our database. But we are still only just scratching the surface of what we need to know to make effective use of RavenDB. In this chapter, we'll go over the major concepts inside RavenDB. 

The first step along the way is to understand what documents _are_.

## Entities, Aggregate Roots and Documents

When using a relational database, you are used to using Entities (hydrated instances of rows from various tables) that makes up a single Aggregate Root. There is also the relatively minor concept of Value Objects, but those tend to be underused, because you _have_ to have a distinct identity for many things in your domain that don't really require it. The classic example is the order line. It has no independent existance, and it must be modified in concert with the whole order.
Yet, in a relational database, an order line must have its own primary key, and it is entirely feasible to change an order independently of the order it is associated with.

We'll dedicate Chapter 4, Document based modeling, for a full discussion on modeling behavior inside RavenDB, but here are the basics. In RavenDB, every document is an Aggregate Root. In fact, we generally don't even bother calling them Aggregate Roots, and just call them Entities. The distinction between an Aggregate and an Entity is only there because of the limitations of relational databases.

An Entity is-a document, and it isn't limited to simple structures such as a key/value map. You can model very complex structures inside a document. In the order and order line case, we'll not model the order and order lines independently. Instead, the order lines will be _embedded_ inside the order. Thus, whenever we want to load the order, we'll get all of the order lines with it. And modification to an order line (be it updating, removing or adding) is a modification to the order as a whole, as it should be.

The order line is now a Value Type, an object that only has meaning within its parent object, not independently. This has a lot of interesting implications. You don't have to worry about Coarse Grain Locking^[You might notice a lot of terms from the Domain Driven Design book used here, that is quite intentional. When we created RavenDB, we intentionally made sure that DDD applications would be a natural usecase for RavenDB.] or partial entity updates. Rules like external references should only be to aggregates are automatically enforced, simply because documents _are_ aggregates, and they are the only thing you can reference.

Documents are independent and coherent. What does those mean? When designing the document structure, you should strive toward creating a document that can be understood in isolation. You should be able to perform operations on a document by loading that single document and operating on it alone. It is rare in RavenDB to need to reference additional documents during write operations. That is enough modeling for now, we'll continue talking about that in the next chapter. Now we are going to go beyond the single document scope, and look at what a collection of documents are.

## Collections

On the face of it, it is pretty easy to explain collections. See Figure 1 as a good example.

![The collections in the Northwind database](.\Ch03\Figure01.png)

It is tempting to think about collections as a set of documents that has the same structure and are stored in the same location. That is not the case, however. Two documents in the same collection can be utterly different from one another in their internal structure. See Figure 2 for one such example.

![Two differently structured documents in the Users collection](.\Ch03\Figure02.png)

Because RavenDB is schemaless, there is no issue with doing this, and the database will accept and work with such documents with ease. This allow RavenDB to handle dynamic and user generated content without any of the hard work that is usually associated with such datasets. It is pretty common to replace EAV^[Entity-Attribute-Value schemas, the common way to handle dynamic data in relational databases. Also notorious for being hard to use, very expensive to query and in general a trouble area you don't want to go into.] systems with RavenDB, because it make such systems very easy to build and use.

RavenDB stores all the documents in the same physical location, and the collection assoication is actually just a different metadata value. The `Raven-Entity-Name` metadata value controls which collection a particular document will belong to. Being a metadata value, it is something that is fully under you control.

> It is common to have the collection name as part of the document id. So a document in the Products collection will have the id of `products/`. That is just a convention, and you can call have a document in the Products collection (because its metadata has the `Raven-Entity-Name` value set to 'Products') while it has the name 'bluebell/butterfly'.

RavenDB does use the collections information to optimize internal operations. Changing the collection once the document is created is _not_ supported. If you need to do that, you'll need delete the document and create it with the same id, but a different collection.

We've talked about the collection value in the metadata, but we have actually talked about what _is_ the metadata. Let talk meta.

## Metadata

The document data is composed of whatever it is that you're storing in the document. For the order document, that would be the shipping details, the order lines, who the customer is, the order priority, etc.
But you also need a place to store additional information, not related to the document itself, but _about_ the document. This is where the metadata comes into place.

The metadata is also a JSON format, just like the document data itself. However, there are some limitations. The property names follow the HTTP Headers convention of being Pascal-Cased. In other words, we separate words with a dash and the first letter of each word is capitalized, everything else is in lower case. This is enforced by RavenDB.

RavenDB uses the metadata to store several pieces of information about the document that it keeps track of:

* The collection name - stored in the `Raven-Entity-Name` metadata property.
* The last modifed date - stored in the `Last-Modified` metadata property^[This is actually stored twice, once as `Last-Modified` and once as `Raven-Last-Modified`, the fisrt is following the RFC 2616 format and is only accurate to the second. The second is accurate to the millisecond.].
* The client side type - stored in the `Raven-Clr-Type` metadata property.
* The etag - stored in the `@etag` metadata property, and discussed at legnth later in this chapter.

You can use the metadata to store your own values, for example, `Last-Modified-By` is a common metadata property that is added when you want to track who changed a document. From the client side, you can access the document metadata using the following code:

	Product product = session.Load<Product>("products/1");
	RavenJObject metadata =  session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(product);
	metadata["Last-Modified-By"] = currentUser.Name;

It is important to note that there will be no extra call to the database to fetch the metadata. Whenever you load the document, the metadata is fetched as well. In fact, we usually need the metadata to materialized the document into an entity.

Once you have the metadata, you can modify it as you wish, as seen in the last line of code. The session tracks changes to both the document and its metadata, and changes to either one of those will cause the document to be updated on the server once `SaveChanges` has been called.

Modifying the metadata in this fashion is possible, but it is pretty rare to do so explicitly in your code. Instead, you'll usually use listeners to do this sort of work.
