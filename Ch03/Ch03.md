We have a running instance of RavenDB, and we have already seen how we can put and get information out of our database. But we are still only just scratching the surface of what we need to know to make effective use of RavenDB. In this chapter, we'll go over the major concepts inside RavenDB. 

The first step along the way is to understand what documents _are_.

## Entities, Aggregate Roots and Documents

When using a relational database, you are used to using Entities (hydrated instances of rows from various tables) that makes up a single Aggregate Root. There is also the relatively minor concept of Value Objects, but those tend to be underused, because you _have_ to have a distinct identity for many things in your domain that don't really require it. The classic example is the order line. It has no independent existance, and it must be modified in concert with the whole order.
Yet, in a relational database, an order line must have its own primary key, and it is entirely feasible to change an order independently of the order it is associated with.

We'll dedicate Chapter 4, Document based modeling, for a full discussion on modeling behavior inside RavenDB, but here are the basics. In RavenDB, every document is an Aggregate Root. In fact, we generally don't even bother calling them Aggregate Roots, and just call them Entities. The distinction between an Aggregate and an Entity is only there because of the limitations of relational databases.

An Entity is-a document, and it isn't limited to simple structures such as a key/value map. You can model very complex structures inside a document. In the order and order line case, we'll not model the order and order lines independently. Instead, the order lines will be _embedded_ inside the order. Thus, whenever we want to load the order, we'll get all of the order lines with it. And modification to an order line (be it updating, removing or adding) is a modification to the order as a whole, as it should be.

The order line is now a Value Type, an object that only has meaning within its parent object, not independently. This has a lot of interesting implications. You don't have to worry about Coarse Grain Locking^[You might notice a lot of terms from the Domain Driven Design book used here, that is quite intentional. When we created RavenDB, we intentionally made sure that DDD applications would be a natural usecase for RavenDB.] or partial entity updates. Rules like external references should only be to aggregates are automatically enforced, simply because documents _are_ aggregates, and they are the only thing you can reference.

Documents are independent and coherent. What does those mean? When designing the document structure, you should strive toward creating a document that can be understood in isolation. You should be able to perform operations on a document by loading that single document and operating on it alone. It is rare in RavenDB to need to reference additional documents during write operations. That is enough modeling for now, we'll continue talking about that in the next chapter. Now we are going to go beyond the single document scope, and look at what a collection of documents are.

## Collections

On the face of it, it is pretty easy to explain collections. See Figure 1 as a good example.

![The collections in the Northwind database](.\Ch03\Figure01.png)

It is tempting to think about collections as a set of documents that has the same structure and are stored in the same location. That is not the case, however. Two documents in the same collection can be utterly different from one another in their internal structure. See Figure 2 for one such example.

![Two differently structured documents in the Users collection](.\Ch03\Figure02.png)

Because RavenDB is schemaless, there is no issue with doing this, and the database will accept and work with such documents with ease. This allow RavenDB to handle dynamic and user generated content without any of the hard work that is usually associated with such datasets. It is pretty common to replace EAV^[Entity-Attribute-Value schemas, the common way to handle dynamic data in relational databases. Also notorious for being hard to use, very expensive to query and in general a trouble area you don't want to go into.] systems with RavenDB, because it make such systems very easy to build and use.

RavenDB stores all the documents in the same physical location, and the collection assoication is actually just a different metadata value. The `Raven-Entity-Name` metadata value controls which collection a particular document will belong to. Being a metadata value, it is something that is fully under you control. 

> Collections & document identifiers
> 
> It is common to have the collection name as part of the document id. So a document in the Products collection will have the id of `products/`. That is just a convention, and you can call have a document in the Products collection (because its metadata has the `Raven-Entity-Name` value set to 'Products') while it has the name 'bluebell/butterfly'.

RavenDB does use the collections information to optimize internal operations. Changing the collection once the document is created is _not_ supported. If you need to do that, you'll need delete the document and create it with the same id, but a different collection.

We've talked about the collection value in the metadata, but we have actually talked about what _is_ the metadata. Let talk meta.

## Metadata

The document data is composed of whatever it is that you're storing in the document. For the order document, that would be the shipping details, the order lines, who the customer is, the order priority, etc.
But you also need a place to store additional information, not related to the document itself, but _about_ the document. This is where the metadata comes into place.

The metadata is also a JSON format, just like the document data itself. However, there are some limitations. The property names follow the HTTP Headers convention of being Pascal-Cased. In other words, we separate words with a dash and the first letter of each word is capitalized, everything else is in lower case. This is enforced by RavenDB.

RavenDB uses the metadata to store several pieces of information about the document that it keeps track of:

* The collection name - stored in the `Raven-Entity-Name` metadata property.
* The last modifed date - stored in the `Last-Modified` metadata property^[This is actually stored twice, once as `Last-Modified` and once as `Raven-Last-Modified`, the fisrt is following the RFC 2616 format and is only accurate to the second. The second is accurate to the millisecond.].
* The client side type - stored in the `Raven-Clr-Type` metadata property.
* The etag - stored in the `@etag` metadata property, and discussed at legnth later in this chapter.

You can use the metadata to store your own values, for example, `Last-Modified-By` is a common metadata property that is added when you want to track who changed a document. From the client side, you can access the document metadata using the following code:

	Product product = session.Load<Product>("products/1");
	RavenJObject metadata =  session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(product);
	metadata["Last-Modified-By"] = currentUser.Name;

It is important to note that there will be no extra call to the database to fetch the metadata. Whenever you load the document, the metadata is fetched as well. In fact, we usually need the metadata to materialized the document into an entity.

Once you have the metadata, you can modify it as you wish, as seen in the last line of code. The session tracks changes to both the document and its metadata, and changes to either one of those will cause the document to be updated on the server once `SaveChanges` has been called.

Modifying the metadata in this fashion is possible, but it is pretty rare to do so explicitly in your code. Instead, you'll usually use listeners to do this sort of work.

## Listeners

It is pretty common to want to run some code whenever something happens in RavenDB. The classic example is when you want to store some audit information about who modified a document. In the previous section, we saw that we can do that manually, but that is both tedious and prone to errors or ommisions. It would be much better if we could do it in a single place.

That is why the RavenDB Client API has the notion of listeners. Listeners allows you to define, in a single place, additional behavior that RavenDB will execute at particular points in time. RavenDB has the following listeners:

* `IDocumentStoreListener` - called when an entity is stored on the server.
* `IDocumentDeleteListener` - called when a document is being deleted.
* `IDocumentQueryListener` - called before a query is made to the server.
* `IDocumentConversionListener` - called when converting an entity to a document and vice versa.
* `IDocumentConflictListener` - called when a replication conflicted is encountered, this listener is discussed in depth in Chapter 10, Replication.

The store and delete listeners are pretty obvious. They are called whenever a document is stored (which can be a new document or an updated to an existing one) or when the document is deleted. A common use case for the store listener is as an audit listener, which can record which user last touched a document. A delete listener can be used to prevent deletion of a document based on your business logic, and a query listener can modify any query issued.

You can see examples of all three in Listing 1.

```{caption="{Store, Delete and Query listeners}" .cs }  
public class AuditStoreListener : IDocumentStoreListener
{
	public bool BeforeStore(string key, 
		object entityInstance, RavenJObject metadata, 
		RavenJObject original)
	{
		metadata["Last-Modified-By"] = WindowsIdentity
			.GetCurrent().Name;
		return false;
	}

	public void AfterStore(string key, 
		object entityInstance, RavenJObject metadata)
	{
	}
}

public class PreventActiveUserDeleteListener : 
	IDocumentDeleteListener
{
	public void BeforeDelete(string key, 
		object entityInstance, RavenJObject metadata)
	{
		var user = entityInstance as User;
		if (user == null)
			return;
		if (user.IsActive)
			throw new InvalidOperationException(
				"Cannot delete active user: " +
				 user.Name);
	}
}

public class OnlyActiveUsersQueryListener : 
	IDocumentQueryListener
{
	public void BeforeQueryExecuted(
		IDocumentQueryCustomization queryCustomization)
	{
		var userQuery = queryCustomization as
			IDocumentQuery<User>;
		if (userQuery == null)
			return;
		userQuery.AndAlso().WhereEquals("IsActive", true);
	}
}
```
In the `AuditStoreListener`, we modify the metadata to include the current user name. Note that we return `false` from the `BeforeStore` method as an indication that we didn't change the `entityInstance` parameter. This is an optimization step, so we won't be forced to re-serialize the `entityInstance` if if wasn't changed by the listener.

In the `PreventActiveUserDeleteListener` case, we throw if an active user is being deleted. This is very straightforward and easy to follow. It is the case of `OnlyActiveUsersQueryListener` that is interesting. Here we check if we are querying on users (by checking if the query to customize is an instance of `IDocumentQuery<User>`) and if it is, we also add a filter on active users only. In this manner, we can ensure that all user queries will operate only on active users.

We register the listeners on the document store during the initialization. Listing 2 shows the updated `CreateDocumentStore` method on the `DocumentStoreHolder` class.

```{caption="Registering listeners in the document store" .cs }   
private static IDocumentStore CreateDocumentStore()
{
	var documentStore = new DocumentStore
	{
		Url = "http://localhost:8080",
		DefaultDatabase = "Northwind",
	};

	documentStore.RegisterListener(
			new AuditStoreListener());
	documentStore.RegisterListener(
			new PreventActiveUserDeleteListener());
	documentStore.RegisterListener(
			new OnlyQueryActiveUsers());

	documentStore.Initialize();
	return documentStore;
}
```

Once registered, the listeners are active and will be called whenever their respected action occur. 

The `IDocumentConversionListener` allows you a fine grained control over the process of the conversion process of entities to documents and vice versa. If you need to pull data from an additional system when a document is loaded, this is usually the place where you'll put it^[That said, pulling data froms secondary sources on document load is frowned upon, documents are coherent and independent. You shouldn't require additional data, and that is usually a performance problem].

A far more common scenario for conversion listener is to handle versioning, whereby you modify the old version of the document to match an update entity definition on the fly. This is a way for you to do rolling migrations, without an expensive stop-the-world step along the way.

While the document conversion listener is a great aid in controling the conversion process, if all you care about is the actual serialization, without the need to run your own logic, it is probably best to go directly to the serializer and use that.

## The Serialization Process

RavenDB uses the [Newtonsoft.JSON](http://james.newtonking.com/json) library for serialization. This is a very rich library with quite a lot of options and levers that you can tweak. 
Because of version incompatibilities between RavenDB and other libraries that also has a dependeny on Newtonsoft.JSON, RavenDB has internalized the Newtonsoft.JSON library. 
To access the RavenDB copy of Newtonsoft.JSON, you need to use the following namespace: `Raven.Imports.Newtonsoft.Json`. 

Newtonsoft.JSON has several options for customizing the serialization process. One of those is a set of attributes (`JsonObjectAttribute`, `JsonPropertyAttribute`, etc). Because RavenDB has its own copy, it is possible to have two sets of such attributes. One for serialization of the entity to a doucment in RavenDB, and another for serialization of the document for external consumption.

Another method of customizing the serialization in Newtonsoft.JSON is using the `documentStore.Conventions.CustomizeJsonSerializer` event.
Whenever a serializer is created by RavenDB, this event is called and allow you to define the serializer's settings. You can see an example of that in Listing 3.

```{caption="Customizing the serialization of money" .cs }   
DocumentStoreHolder.Store.Conventions
	.CustomizeJsonSerializer += serializer => 
	{
		serializer.Converters.Add(new JsonMoneyConverter());
	};

public class JsonMoneyConverter : JsonConverter
{
	public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, 
		object value, JsonSerializer serializer)
	{
		var money = (Money) value;
		writer.WriteValue(money.Amount + " " + money.Currency);
	}

	public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, 
		Type objectType, object existingValue, 
		JsonSerializer serializer)
	{
		var parts = reader.ReadAsString().Split();
		return new Money
		{
			Amount = decimal.Parse(parts[0]),
			Currency = parts[1]
		};
	}

	public override bool CanConvert(Type objectType)
	{
		return objectType == typeof (Money);
	}
}

public class Money
{
	public string Currency { get; set; }
	public decimal Amount { get; set; }
}
```
The idea in Listing 3 is to have a `Money` object that holds both the amount and the currency, but to serialize it to JSON as a string string property. So a `Money` object reprensenting 10 US Dollars would be serialized to the following string: "10 USD".

The JsonMoneyConverter converts to and from the string representation, and the json serializer customization event register the converter with the serializer. Note that this is probably not a good idea, and you will want to store the `Money` without modifications, so you can do things like sum up order by currentcy, or actually work with the data.

I would only consider using this approach as an intermediary step, probably as part of a migration if I had two versions of the application working concurrently on the same database.

## Document Identifiers

A document id in RavenDB is how we identify a single document from all the rest. They are the moral equivalent for the primary key in a relational system. Unlike a primary key, which is unique per table, all the documents in a database share the same key space^[Remember, collections are a virtual concept]. 

> Identifiers terminology
> 
> Document identifiers are also called document keys, or just ids or keys. In the nomenclature of RavenDB, we use both keys and ids to refer to a document id.

### Don't use Guids

Therefor, it follows that one of the chief requirements of the document ids is that they would be unique. This turn out to be a not so trivial problem to solve. A simple way to handle that is to use a Guid, such as this one:

	92260D13-A032-4BCC-9D18-10749898AE1C

It is entirely possible to use Guids as document identifers in RavenDB. But it is also possible to to drive to work on a unicycle. Possible doesn't mean advisable. Guids are used because they are easy to generate, but they suffer from weaknesses when it comes to their use as a unique identifier, they are relatively big compare to other methods and are nonsequential.

Those two means that it is easy to get a database into a situation where it has to do a _lot_ more work just to get data in when you are using a Guid. But that isn't their chief problem. The problem is that they are utterly opaque to humans. We often use identifiers for many purposes. Debugging and trouble shooting are not the least of those.

And having to look at 92260D13-A032-4BBC-9D18-10749898AE1C and see what did we do with it along the way is not a realy good way to spend your time. If you ever had to read a Guid over the phone, or keep track of multiple Guids in a log file, or just didn't realize that the Guid in this paragraph and the Guid higher up in the page aren't in fact he same Guid...

Guids aren't good for us. And by us, I mean humans.

### Human readable identifiers

A much better alternative is the default approach used by RavenDB, using the collection name as a prefix with a numberic id to distigiush different documents. You've already seens examples of this default approach. We have "products/1", "orders/15", etc.

This approach has several advantages. It tend to generate small and sequential keys, and most importantly, these type of keys are human readable and easily understood.

The question now is, how do we get this numeric suffix? 

### High/low algorithm

The problem with generating unique values is that you might not be the only one that want to generate them at this particular moment in time. So we have to ensure that we don't get duplicates.

One way to do that is to use a single source for id generation, which will be responsible for never handing out a duplicate value. RavenDB supports that option, and you can read about it in the next section, Identity.
However, such an approach requires going to the same source each and every time that we need to generate an identifier. 

The default approach used by RavenDB is quite different. We use a set of documents call the hilo documents. Here is a list of those documents in the Northwind database:

* Raven/Hilo/categories
* Raven/Hilo/companies
* Raven/Hilo/employees
* Raven/Hilo/orders
* Raven/Hilo/products
* Raven/Hilo/regions
* Raven/Hilo/shippers
* Raven/Hilo/suppliers

Those are pretty trivial documents, they all have just a single property, `Max`. That property's value is the maximum possible number that has been generated (or will be generated) for that collection.
When we need to generate a new identifier for a particular collection, we fetch that document and get the current max value. We then add to that max value and update the document.

We now have a range, between the old max value and the updated max value. Within this range, we are free to generate identifier with the assurance that no one else can generate such an identifier as well.

The benefit of this approach is that this also generate roughly sequential keys, even in the presence of multiple clients generating identifiers concurrently.

#### Self optimizing

The basis of the hilo algorithm is that a client that needs to generate 10 ids, it can take a range of 10 when it communicate with the server. From then on, it can generate those ids independently from the server until it runs out of ids.

Of course, you usually don't know upfront how many ids you'll want to generate, so you guess. By default, we use 32 as the default range, but the nice thing about the hilo approach is that it is the client that control how much to take.

Remember how we said that RavenDB is self optimizing? Here is one such case. When the client runs out of the reserved id range, it has to go back to the server to get a new reserved range. When it does so, it checks to see how much time has passed since the last time it had to go to the server. If the time is too short, that is an indication that we are burning through a lot of ids. In order to reduce the number of remote calls, the client will then request a range twice as big as before.

In other words, we start by requesting a range of 32. We consume that quickly, and we request a range of 64, and so on. Very quickly, we find the balance where we don't have to go to the server too often to get new ids. 

The actual mechanics are a bit more complex, because we scale up higher than just by a power of two in practice. We also have the ability to reduce the size of the range we request if we aren't going through the range fast enough. 

The actual details of how it works is not part of the algorithm, those are internal implementation optimization detail. But it is important to understand the benefits that you get when using this.

#### Concurrency

So far, we talked about hilo as if there was just a single client talking to the server. The question is, what happens when there are two clients requesting a range in the same time.

> Requesting a hilo range
>
> While the terminology we use is "requesting a range", the RavenDB server isn't actually aware of the hilo protocol in any meaningful way. Requesting a range is a process that involved loading the document, updating the Max value and saving it back. 
> 
> Aside from those basic operations, all the behavior for hilo is implemented client side.

As you'll see toward the end of the chatper, RavenDB supports optimistic concurrency, and the hilo protocol takes advantage of this. When we save the document back after raising the Max value, we do so in a way that would throw a `ConcurrencyException` if the document has been changed in the meantime. 
If we get this error, we retry the entire process from the beginning, fetching the document again, recording the current Max value, then saving with the new Max.

This way, we are protected against multiple clients overwriting one another's changes and generating duplicate ids.
