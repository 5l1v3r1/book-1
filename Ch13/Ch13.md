## Security

The Internet is often seen as a magical grove, with the sum total of human knowledge at your fingertips and a land of unlimited
opportunities. If you dig down just a little bit, you'll find that this is not a magic grove, but a haunted woods. The Internet
is a hostile place, with very little trust given or expected. A network packet traveling between two machines is likely to 
be intercepted, inspected, logged and modified before it reaches its destination. 

From re-writing links to downloads to include malware to phising sites that will steal your passwords and then your identity, the
ideal of a network that is safe to browse is very far from reality. You don't typically notice this, because the baseline 
assumption is, and has been for a while, that the network itself it hostile. Website uses certificates and top of the line 
encryption to idenitify themselves and hide the content of requests and responses over the wire, digital signatures are sent and
validated automatically by your browser and platform.

We have reached the stage where it is required to use military grade encryption, to upload the lunch selfie that is going to be 
uploaded to the cloud for all to see. There is so much encryption around us that we don't really notice. From the green lock icon
on the browser to common chat platforms employing end to end encryption, forward security and authentication. When the network is
hostile, only the foolish will go forth without the armor of encryption.

This chapter is not meant to be a thorough discussion of security practices in general. There have been many books published on 
the subject that deals in many aspects of the problem. From how to protect your data and services to how to break into 
insufficently protected locations and ransack their contents. 

We are going to focus on understanding the threat model your RavenDB instances face and what kind of features RavenDB has to deal
with such threats. This chapter is all controlling who can access the data inside your databases, protecting the conversation 
between client applications and that database from being eavesdropped or modified as well as protecting the data on disk from 
being usable if it is stolen.

So far, we have run RavenDB in its unsecured configuration, suitable only for development work in a secured network. In any other
case, you'll want to run RavenDB in a secured mode. A core part of the design of RavenDB has been security, and most importantly,
making sure that running RavenDB in a secured fashion is _easy_ enough to be the default. 

### Introduction to transport level security and authentication

I'm going to assume that you have little to no knowledge about security. This is likely false, but it is better to give you 
information that you already have than miss something critical. Securing a RavenDB server requires that we'll take care of the 
following issues:

1. Allow the client to verify that the database server is indeed the one we wanted to talk to. 
2. Allow the server to verify that the client is a valid one and to decide what access it should have.
3. Prevent anyone else from eavedropping to the communication between server and client, hijack the client credentials, etc.

RavenDB is not the first to have these set of requirements and instead of rolling our system^[Roll your own is usually a _bad_
idea with security practices.] it uses the TLS 1.2^[TLS - Transport Level Security, the successor to SSL and what is actually 
used when you are using HTTPS, for example.] protocol. You might not be familiar with the term, but a more common use name for
this is HTTPS. RavenDB uses TLS 1.2 in the following ways:

* The database server identifies itself with a `X509` certificate to clients.
* Clients use `X509` client certificate to identify itself to the server.
* All traffic between the database and clients is encrypted.

TLS 1.2 is the recommended protocol for secured communication by NIST and PCI 3.1 and in Dec 2017 was the chosen protocol for
close to 90% of the entire encrypted web traffic world wide.

If you have previously deployed a website or application using HTTPS, you are already familiar with the key problem of using 
TLS / HTTPS, the certificate. Rather more to the point, _getting_ a certificate.

A certificate, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate), is: "is an electronic document
used to prove the ownership of a public key". That doesn't really mean much to a layperson. A certificate is a way for a service
to identify itself in a crytographically secured manner. There are two types of certificates that usually interest us, self-signed
certificates and certificated signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). 

A self signed certificate is similar to a post-it note at a class reunion, while a certificate signed by a CA is more like an 
official ID. Figure 13.1 might make things easier to explain.

![Self signed vs. CA certificates, in real world terms.](./Ch13/img01.png)

Unlike the real world, certificate uses cryptographic signatures to identify themselves. You can assume that if the connection
is using a certificate, then no outside party can listen to the contents of the traffic between client and server. That, as it
turns out to be, is just half of the issue. Consider going to your class re-union, seeing a name tag that say "Your Best 
Friend From High School" and then whispering a dire secret to that person. 

You can be sure that your secret has only reached that person's ears, but the fact that they have a name tag with a particular
name doesn't actually mean that they _are_ that person. In the real world, you'll typically use a government issued id to 
verify identity. There is a much higher level of trust given to a driver license with your details than to a post-it note with
a hand written name.

In the same sense, you have a self signed certificate (which ensures that the connection is private, but doesn't gurantee who
you are talking to) and you have a CA signed certificate. A CA is supposed to do some level of validation before issuing a 
certificate. And as part of issuing the certificate, it will sign it using its own cryptographic signature. This way, you have
a list of trusted CA (called the Root CAs) and by default you'll trust that certificates that you run into that are signed by
those CA are valid.

> 
> There are different types of certificates that you can use. They range from Domain Validation (DV), code signing, Extended

A CA can be one of the global Root CAs (such as Comodo, IdenTrust, DigiCert and Let's Encrypt), which are trusted by most 
browsers and operating systems or it can be a local CA. For example, the operations teams define a root certificate that is 
trusted by all your machines, and used that to generate certificates. The real world parallel for a local root CA is 
accepting employee ID cards as proof of identity inside a company. 

#### Certificate usage inside RavenDB

RavenDB uses certificates for all communication and authentication needs. This has the advantage that _anything_ can talk to
RavenDB, because HTTPS is so widely supported. Operations teams are also used to handling certificates, securely storing them,
renewal, revocation, etc. 

By default, the client API will trust the server if the server's certificate is a match to the expected URL, the certificate is
valid and the certificate is signed by a trusted party. You can override such decisions by setting the 
`RequestExecutor.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` and do you validation logic there. This is useful if you are using
self-signed certificates that aren't trusted by the client, or if you want to verify additional properties on the certificate. 

When running in a secured mode, RavenDB required that the client, as well, will authenticate using a `X509` certificate. This
is called a client certificate and it allows the client and server to establish a mutually authenticated channel between them.
The server certificate requires that the client trust it and using the Root CA and the trust chains that are 
defined on the client machine. For the server to trust a client certificate, that certificate needs to be explicitly registered
in the cluster.

>
> The reasoning is that by not allowing a secured server with no authentication we prevent operator mistakes from exposing

> difficult to do by accident. 

We'll go through exactly how to do that in the next section, for now, I want to focus on the general theory and what exactly
is going on before diving into how you'll operate it.

Client certificate are easy, the only thing that needs to trust them is RavenDB, and we can either register a certificate
with the cluster directly, or ask the cluster to generate them for us. Getting a server certificate is usually much more
complex, because you need to deal with trust issues and in many organizations, access to certifciates is tightly controlled
(and right so). 

Let's us see what RavenDB does to make secured setup easier. 

### Setting RavenDB up in a secured fashion

Setting up RavenDB in a secured mode is a fairly simple process. You can do it yourself by setting the right configuration values
and deploy it directly. However, the first time that you'll start a RavenDB instance you'll be direct to the setup wizard, where
you can make important decisions about how RavenDB will be deployed. You can see how this look slike in Figure 13.2. 

![The setup wizard is the first screen you'll see when accessing RavenDB for the first time](./Ch13/img02.png)

You have four options available. You can setup RavenDB by generating a certificate through `Let's Encrypt`, use your own 
certificate, setup RavenDB in _unsecured_ mode or complete the setup process for a cluster node that was started on another
instance. 

> **Using `Let's Encrypt`**
>
> Part of the reason TLS and HTTPS aren't used everywhere is the issue of certificates. In order for a certificate to be useful
> you need it to be trusted, which means that you need to get it from one of the Root CAs. Up until recently, that was something
> that you could only get in a commercial setting. This severly limited HTTPS adoption and made it a lot more complex
> 
> Enter `Let's Encrypt`, whose mission is to bring HTTPS everywhere, by providing free, trusted, certificiates to all in an 
> fully-automated manner. The only requirement that `Let's Encrypt` has is that you prove in some manner that own the domain
> for which you are requesting a certificate. 

The online documentation does an excellent job in walking you through all the options of setting up RavenDB, so I'm not going
to go into detail on each and every option. Instead, I'm going to walk you through setting up a RavenDB cluster in a production
mode in as few a steps as possible. Right now, my focus is the security of the solution, we'll talk a lot more about deployment
options on later chapters.

First, uncompress the RavenDB server package (available on the [https://ravendb.net/downloads](https://ravendb.net/downloads))
three times, to `raven/srv-a`, `raven/srv-b` and `raven/srv-c`. We are going to run three instances of RavenDB on a single 
machine, but you can follow the exact same steps to setup RavenDB on multiple machines. Just be sure to get the IP addresses
correctly and to open the relevant ports in the firewalls.

> **`Let's Encrypt` is completely optional**
> 
> It's important to note that this part of the process is _entirely_ optional. You can run your RavenDB instance using your own
> certificates and your own domains. This is provided to make it easy to setup RavenDB in a secured manner.
> 
> For most operation teams, certificate and domain management is their bread and butter and RavenDB couldn't care less about
> where you got your certificate from. You can use the same setup process with your own certificate by selecting 
> `Provide Your Own Certificate` option. 

First, run the `raven/srv-a/run.sh` (Linux) or `raven/srv-a/run.ps1` (Windows) script. This should start the RavenDB instance
and open your browser automatically. If this does not happen, look for the `"Server available on: <url>"` line on the 
command line and go the the specified url. 

You should see a screen similar to Figure 13.2. 

> **Automatic certificate generation requires a (free) license**
>
> `Let's Encrypt`'s free certificate generation helps a lot, but to actually generate a certificate, you need to have a domain
> that you own that you can use to generate the certificate. In many cases, you are deploying only internally, without having
> any external access.
>
> To alleviate a lot of the complexity of such deployment, RavenDB take upon itself to handle all of that. The RavenDB team is
> managing a set of root level domains from which it allocates subdomains to users, and RavenDB uses these subdomains to create
> the certificate.
> 
> These domains looks like: `<name>.development.run` or `<name>.ravendb.community`, where you can provide any `<name>` you want
> as long as it wasn't taken first by someone else. 
>
> Names are provided on a first come, first serve basis, and once they have been given to a user, they are associated with the
> user permenantly. This is because we need to be sure that only a single user ever got a specific domain. 
> This is to avoid the option of two users having certificates to the same domain, which will allow them to capture traffic 
> meant to the other.
> 
> You can request a free license from the RavenDB site and use that license during the setup process to register your domain name
> and then get the certificate to run RavenDB securely. That license is tied then tied to the domain and can be used later to 
> modify the domain's settings and to generate another certificate. 

On the setup screen, select the `Generate Let's Encrypt Certificate`, provide the license that you recieved over email (you can
get a free license by registering on the RavenDB website) and click next. You can see the next screen in Figure 13.3.

![The domain selection page allows you to select the name of your cluster.](./Ch13/img03.png)

The domain selection screen in Figure 13.3 is where you can select your domain name. This will also be how you'll usually refer to
your cluster. If this is the first time you are running through the process, you'll need to select name. As long as it isn't already
taken by someone else, you will be granted the name. If you have already setup RavenDB, you'll be able to select from the domain 
names you have previous registered. After selecting the domain name, click next. 

You'll be faced with the cluster setup, as shown in Figure 13.4. We're setting a local cluster, so set the `HTTP Port` to `443`,
the `IP Address` to `127.0.1.1` for node `A`. Note that this is `127.0.1.1`, _not_ `127.0.0.1`, which you are more used to. In this 
case we are relying on the fact that the entire `127.x.x.x` IP range has been reserved for the loopback device. Why use `127.0.1.1`,
then? Because we want to bind to the HTTPS port 443 by default, and it is unlikely that someone has already bound to `127.0.1.1:443`.

For production, you'll obvious not have to fight some other program^[I'm looking at you, Skype.] for access to a port, but I'm assuming
that you will run this exercise on your own machine to start with. You can see what this should look like in Figure 13.4. 

![Setting up a cluster of 3 machines, including setting of DNS records](./Ch13/img04.png)

If you'll look at the left portion of Figure 13.4, you'll see a list of nodes (`A`, `B` and `C`). As we already seen in 
[Chapter 6](#clustering-setup), we usually use the letters of the alphabet to name the nodes in the cluster. Click on `Add node` 
to add node `B` on your system and give is the IP `127.0.1.2`, thenk do this again for node `C` with the IP `127.0.1.3`.

If you are deploying to multiple machines, make sure that the IPs
are correct, that the ports are available and that the firewall permits the machines to talk to one another. In particular, note that
RavenDB actually uses two ports, one for HTTPS (usually 443) and one for TCP (usually 38888). You'll need to open both boths for 
incoming connections in the firewall.
The setup process supports binding to an internal IP and register the DNS name to an external IP (common in cloud platforms such as
AWS, Azure, etc).

Assuming you went with `127.0.1.1` and local cluster, you are now ready and can hit the next button. The next little bit should take 
about a minute or two, as RavenDB contacts `Let's Encrypt`, completes the DNS challenge to prove that you are now in control of 
the domain you have selected (in my case, this is `raven.development.run`, yours will be different and unique to you, of course).
Along with generating the certificate via `Let's Encrypt`, RavenDB does another very important action, it updates the _global_ 
DNS records to setup the domain name you have chosen with the IPs you have setup.

> wrong an in many cases how to fix it. Common reasons for setup failure include:
>
> * Another application is already listening on the port.
> * On Linux, using port 443 usually requires root. You can either use a higher port (such as 8443) or use 
>   `sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /path/to/Raven.Server` to grant the RavenDB binary the rights to bind to a low numbered port.
> * Check if your anti virus / proxy is preventing RavenDB from binding to the network or clients to access it.
> * Your firewall is blocking incoming network connections, so you cannot connect to RavenDB.
> * Your DNS server is aggresively caching and you can't see the DNS updates made by RavenDB to the domain you have chosen. 
>   You can set your DNS server to `8.8.8.8` to avoid that or wait about 30 minutes for the usual refresh cycle.

Upon successful completeion of the setup, you'll see some informative output with details about your newly defined cluster.
In addition to the success message from the setup, your browser has also downloaded a `.zip` file. This file is critical and should
be saved carefully. You can see the contents of this file in Figure 13.5.

![Contents of the setup `.zip` file with everything you need to get your cluster started.](./Ch13/img05.png)

The file contains a client certifcate with admin level privileges to the cluster (`admin.client.certificate.raven`), the license used
and a readme file with additional setup instructions. In Figure 13.5 you can also see that there are three directories there, `A`,`B` 
and `C`. These contain the configuration _and the server certificate_ for each of the nodes in the cluster. Depending on your 
organization policies, you might need to store them them separately. We'll touch on that toward the end of this chapter. 

You should install the admin client certificate into your browser. If you are using Chrome, double clicking on the certificate should 
usually start the wizard to do so. Otherwise, use `Settings`, `Manage certificates`, `Import...` inside Chrome to import the client
certificate. 

Once that is done, you can click on the `Restart Server` button at the end of the setup screen. The browser should then redirect you
to the RavenDB management studio. However, at this point we are actually running a secured server, and you need to authenticate 
yourself to the server. This is the purpose of installing the admin certificate. You should get a dialog similar to the one shown
in Figure 13.6 and should select the appropriate certificate (if you have more than one)^[If you made a mistake with the certificate
select and chose the wrong one (or cancelled the dialog), you'll need to close Chrome and start it again to make it forget this 
decision. Creating an incognito window also works, and might be easier.].

![Chrome certificate selection dialog for your RavenDB instance](./Ch13/img06.png)

You should now see the see the studio's dashboard. A new feature that is now available is the "Who am I?" notification. Look at the 
bottom of the window, you'll see a bright green lock icon. Hovering on that will reveal to you what certificate you are using and
what permissions are available to you. You can see an example of this in Figure 13.7.

![The "Who am I" feature gives you details about how you authenticated to the server and the permissions you are granted.](./Ch13/img07.png)

At this point, we are done setting up a single node, but we haven't actually setup the cluster, have we? In the studio, go to 
`Manage Server` and then `Cluster` and you'll see that node `A` is up but both `B` and `C` show up in red. This is because we haven't
even started either `B` or `C`.

#### Setting up the rest of the cluster

You can now run the `raven/srv-b/run.sh` (Linux) or `raven/srv-b/run.ps1` (Windows) script. This will start up a new instance of RavenDB,
also in initial setup mode. Unlike the previous iteration, we don't need to do much. At the bottom of the setup window, you have the 
`Continue cluster setup for new node`, as you can see in Figure 13.2. Click on that button and then upload the `.zip` file that you 
got from the first node, select node `B` in the drop down and then click `next`.  You can see how this looks like in Figure 13.8.

![Completing the setup process for the second node in the cluster](./Ch13/img08.png)

You should get the success screen again, with details about the setup. Click on `Restart server` at the bottom and you are done. If you'll
look now under the `Manage Server` and then `Cluster` in node `A` you'll see that it had recognized that node `B` is functional, 
connected to it and fully joined it to the cluster. You can now repeat the process with node `C` to complete the cluster setup.

This is it, you now have a cluster of three nodes. You have a valid certifcate that is broadly trusted that is used to secure all
access to the cluster. Authentication to the cluster is done via the generated admin client certificate (and you'll learn more about
authentication in RavenDB later in this chapter). The setup process also updated the DNS system for your cluster, so you can put
`https://a.raven.development.run`^[Your URL will obviously be a bit different] and go node `A`, or `https://b.raven.development.run`
to go to node `B`, etc. 

> **Updating the certificate over time**
>
> A certificate has a time limit built into it. In the case of `Let's Encrypt`, the certificates are generated for a maximum on 
> 90 days. This means, operationally speaking, that you'll need to replace them. You don't usually need to worry about that, in
> the same way that the certificate was automatically generated for you during the setup, RavenDB will make sure to update the
> certificate when it is needed (with plenty of buffer to avoid issues).
>
> RavenDB will take care of updating the certificate, distributing the new certificate to the rest of the cluster, orchestrating
> the certificate replacement (this is done live, without any downtime on any node) when all the nodes have the new certificate.
>
> If there are any issues in the process, RavenDB will alert the operations team in plenty of time to handle it. It will also 
> be retry on regular basis to avoid being blocked by any transient errors. 

In other words, you are pretty much done as far as the setup is concerned. What is left is to create databases, create certificates
so applications and users can connect to the cluster (and not as the cluster admin!) and that's _it_. Even ongoing maintenance in 
the form of refreshing the certificate is done for you automatically and transparently.

#### Security concerns with the automated setup

The automated setup is nice. I'm really happy about it and it can save you a lot of time an effort. It is also a feature that is 
primarily aimed at developers running a secured system locally, small applications that don't get a lot of operator attention. 
However, that has a cost. In order to make this process seamless, RavenDB uses `api.ravendb.net` to answer the `Let's Encrypt`
DNS challenge and update the DNS records to point to your server. 

This is provided as courtesy for RavenDB users, but for mission critical systems, it is recommended that your operations team
will take ownership on that. The actual certificate is generated on _your_ machine, not on any machine that is owned by us, 
however, given that your don't own the domain name for you cluster, you have to go through `api.ravendb.net` for any change.

We are not in the business of providing hosting, nor is there any 24x7 support for things like "I need to change the server IP
address on this node". For production systems, you are encouraged to run this on systems that you control.

A security audit of your system will also point out that since we own the domain name, we can generate our own certificate for
your cluster domain. We obviously promise to do no such thing (and you can check the certificate transparency logs to verify
that), but running a critical system is best done on your own systems and under your control

> **Certificate transparency**
>
> Every certificate generated by a Root CA is registered in the public certificate transparency logs. This means that in order

> acceptable, and that will be very visible in the certificate transparent logs. 

Nevertheless, consider the automated setup to be something akin to training wheels on a bicycle. Really useful to get you 
going, but something that you intend to grow out of in the fullness of time. 

The setup process when you provide your own certificate is actually _faster_ and provide the same experience and ease of use, 
without having to worry about 3rd parties.
