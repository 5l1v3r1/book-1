## Security

The Internet is often seen as a magical grove, with the sum total of human knowledge at your fingertips and a land of unlimited
opportunities. If you dig down just a little bit, you'll find that this is not a magic grove, but a haunted woods. The Internet
is a hostile place, with very little trust given or expected. A network packet traveling between two machines is likely to 
be intercepted, inspected, logged and modified before it reaches its destination. 

From re-writing links to downloads to include malware to phising sites that will steal your passwords and then your identity, the
ideal of a network that is safe to browse is very far from reality. You don't typically notice this, because the baseline 
assumption is, and has been for a while, that the network itself it hostile. Website uses certificates and top of the line 
encryption to idenitify themselves and hide the content of requests and responses over the wire, digital signatures are sent and
validated automatically by your browser and platform.

We have reached the stage where it is required to use military grade encryption, to upload the lunch selfie that is going to be 
uploaded to the cloud for all to see. There is so much encryption around us that we don't really notice. From the green lock icon
on the browser to common chat platforms employing end to end encryption, forward security and authentication. When the network is
hostile, only the foolish will go forth without the armor of encryption.

This chapter is not meant to be a thorough discussion of security practices in general. There have been many books published on 
the subject that deals in many aspects of the problem. From how to protect your data and services to how to break into 
insufficently protected locations and ransack their contents. 

We are going to focus on understanding the threat model your RavenDB instances face and what kind of features RavenDB has to deal
with such threats. This chapter is all controlling who can access the data inside your databases, protecting the conversation 
between client applications and that database from being eavesdropped or modified as well as protecting the data on disk from 
being usable if it is stolen.

So far, we have run RavenDB in its unsecured configuration, suitable only for development work in a secured network. In any other
case, you'll want to run RavenDB in a secured mode. A core part of the design of RavenDB has been security, and most importantly,
making sure that running RavenDB in a secured fashion is _easy_ enough to be the default. 

### Introduction to transport level security and authentication

I'm going to assume that you have little to no knowledge about security. This is likely false, but it is better to give you 
information that you already have than miss something critical. Securing a RavenDB server requires that we'll take care of the 
following issues:

1. Allow the client to verify that the database server is indeed the one we wanted to talk to. 
2. Allow the server to verify that the client is a valid one and to decide what access it should have.
3. Prevent anyone else from eavedropping to the communication between server and client, hijack the client credentials, etc.

RavenDB is not the first to have these set of requirements and instead of rolling our system^[Roll your own is usually a _bad_
idea with security practices.] it uses the TLS 1.2^[TLS - Transport Level Security, the successor to SSL and what is actually 
used when you are using HTTPS, for example.] protocol. You might not be familiar with the term, but a more common use name for
this is HTTPS. RavenDB uses TLS 1.2 in the following ways:

* The database server identifies itself with a `X509` certificate to clients.
* Clients use `X509` client certificate to identify itself to the server.
* All traffic between the database and clients is encrypted.

TLS 1.2 is the recommended protocol for secured communication by NIST and PCI 3.1 and in Dec 2017 was the chosen protocol for
close to 90% of the entire encrypted web traffic world wide.

If you have previously deployed a website or application using HTTPS, you are already familiar with the key problem of using 
TLS / HTTPS, the certificate. Rather more to the point, _getting_ a certificate.

A certificate, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate), is: "is an electronic document
used to prove the ownership of a public key". That doesn't really mean much to a layperson. A certificate is a way for a service
to identify itself in a crytographically secured manner. There are two types of certificates that usually interest us, self-signed
certificates and certificated signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). 

A self signed certificate is similar to a post-it note at a class reunion, while a certificate signed by a CA is more like an 
official ID. Figure 13.1 might make things easier to explain.

![Self signed vs. CA certificates, in real world terms.](./Ch13/img01.png)

Unlike the real world, certificate uses cryptographic signatures to identify themselves. You can assume that if the connection
is using a certificate, then no outside party can listen to the contents of the traffic between client and server. That, as it
turns out to be, is just half of the issue. Consider going to your class re-union, seeing a name tag that say "Your Best 
Friend From High School" and then whispering a dire secret to that person. 

You can be sure that your secret has only reached that person's ears, but the fact that they have a name tag with a particular
name doesn't actually mean that they _are_ that person. In the real world, you'll typically use a government issued id to 
verify identity. There is a much higher level of trust given to a driver license with your details than to a post-it note with
a hand written name.

In the same sense, you have a self signed certificate (which ensures that the connection is private, but doesn't gurantee who
you are talking to) and you have a CA signed certificate. A CA is supposed to do some level of validation before issuing a 
certificate. And as part of issuing the certificate, it will sign it using its own cryptographic signature. This way, you have
a list of trusted CA (called the Root CAs) and by default you'll trust that certificates that you run into that are signed by
those CA are valid.

A CA can be one of the global Root CAs (such as Comodo, IdenTrust, DigiCert and Let's Encrypt), which are trusted by most 
browsers and operating systems or it can be a local CA. For example, the operations teams define a root certificate that is 
trusted by all your machines, and used that to generate certificates. The real world parallel for a local root CA is 
accepting employee ID cards as proof of identity inside a company. 

#### Certificate usage inside RavenDB

RavenDB uses certificates for all communication and authentication needs. This has the advantage that _anything_ can talk to
RavenDB, because HTTPS is so widely supported. Operations teams are also used to handling certificates, securely storing them,
renewal, revocation, etc. 

By default, the client API will trust the server if the server's certificate is a match to the expected URL, the certificate is
valid and the certificate is signed by a trusted party. You can override such decisions by setting the 
`RequestExecutor.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` and do you validation logic there. This is useful if you are using
self-signed certificates that aren't trusted by the client, or if you want to verify additional properties on the certificate. 

When running in a secured mode, RavenDB required that the client, as well, will authenticate using a `X509` certificate. This
is called a client certificate and it allows the client and server to establish a mutually authenticated channel between them.
The server certificate requires that the client trust it and using the Root CA and the trust chains that are 
defined on the client machine. For the server to trust a client certificate, that certificate needs to be explicitly registered
in the cluster. 

We'll go through exactly how to do that in the next section, for now, I want to focus on the general theory and what exactly
is going on before diving into how you'll operate it.
