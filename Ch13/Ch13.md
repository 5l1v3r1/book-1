## Security

The Internet is often seen as a magical grove, with the sum total of human knowledge at your fingertips and a land of unlimited
opportunities. If you dig down just a little bit, you'll find that this is not a magic grove, but a haunted woods. The Internet
is a hostile place, with very little trust given or expected. A network packet traveling between two machines is likely to 
be intercepted, inspected, logged and modified before it reaches its destination. 

From re-writing links to downloads to include malware to phising sites that will steal your passwords and then your identity, the
ideal of a network that is safe to browse is very far from reality. You don't typically notice this, because the baseline 
assumption is, and has been for a while, that the network itself it hostile. Website uses certificates and top of the line 
encryption to idenitify themselves and hide the content of requests and responses over the wire, digital signatures are sent and
validated automatically by your browser and platform.

We have reached the stage where it is required to use military grade encryption, to upload the lunch selfie that is going to be 
uploaded to the cloud for all to see. There is so much encryption around us that we don't really notice. From the green lock icon
on the browser to common chat platforms employing end to end encryption, forward security and authentication. When the network is
hostile, only the foolish will go forth without the armor of encryption.

This chapter is not meant to be a thorough discussion of security practices in general. There have been many books published on 
the subject that deals in many aspects of the problem. From how to protect your data and services to how to break into 
insufficently protected locations and ransack their contents. 

We are going to focus on understanding the threat model your RavenDB instances face and what kind of features RavenDB has to deal
with such threats. This chapter is all controlling who can access the data inside your databases, protecting the conversation 
between client applications and that database from being eavesdropped or modified as well as protecting the data on disk from 
being usable if it is stolen.

So far, we have run RavenDB in its unsecured configuration, suitable only for development work in a secured network. In any other
case, you'll want to run RavenDB in a secured mode. A core part of the design of RavenDB has been security, and most importantly,
making sure that running RavenDB in a secured fashion is _easy_ enough to be the default. 

### Introduction to transport level security and authentication

I'm going to assume that you have little to no knowledge about security. This is likely false, but it is better to give you 
information that you already have than miss something critical. Securing a RavenDB server requires that we'll take care of the 
following issues:

1. Allow the client to verify that the database server is indeed the one we wanted to talk to. 
2. Allow the server to verify that the client is a valid one and to decide what access it should have.
3. Prevent anyone else from eavedropping to the communication between server and client, hijack the client credentials, etc.

RavenDB is not the first to have these set of requirements and instead of rolling our system^[Roll your own is usually a _bad_
idea with security practices.] it uses the TLS 1.2^[TLS - Transport Level Security, the successor to SSL and what is actually 
used when you are using HTTPS, for example.] protocol. You might not be familiar with the term, but a more common use name for
this is HTTPS. RavenDB uses TLS 1.2 in the following ways:

* The database server identifies itself with a `X509` certificate to clients.
* Clients use `X509` client certificate to identify itself to the server.
* All traffic between the database and clients is encrypted.

TLS 1.2 is the recommended protocol for secured communication by NIST and PCI 3.1 and in Dec 2017 was the chosen protocol for
close to 90% of the entire encrypted web traffic world wide.

If you have previously deployed a website or application using HTTPS, you are already familiar with the key problem of using 
TLS / HTTPS, the certificate. Rather more to the point, _getting_ a certificate.

A certificate, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate), is: "is an electronic document
used to prove the ownership of a public key". That doesn't really mean much to a layperson. A certificate is a way for a service
to identify itself in a crytographically secured manner. There are two types of certificates that usually interest us, self-signed
certificates and certificated signed by a Certificate Authority. 

A self signed certificate is similar to a post-it note at a class reunion, while a certificate signed by a CA is more like an 
official ID. Figure 13.1 might make things easier to explain.
