In the previous chapter, we talked about dynamic indexes and the query optimizer. For the most part, those serve very well to free you from the need to manually deal with indexing. Pretty much all of the standard queries can be safely handed over to the query optimizer and it will take care of that.

That leave us to deal with all of the non standard queries. Those can be full text search, spatial queries, querying on dynamic fields or any real complexity. That isn't to say that defining static indexes in RavenDB is complex, only that they are required when the query optimizer can't really guess what you wanted.

By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to create static index in the stuido and in your code, how to version them in your source control system and how to make RavenDB sit down, beg and (most importantly) go and fetch the right documents for you.

## Creating indexes

We'll start with the simplest possible index, just finding companies by their country. Go to the Northwind database in the Studio, and then to the indexes tab, create a new index, name it "Companies/ByCountry" and then fill
