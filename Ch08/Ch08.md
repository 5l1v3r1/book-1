## Sharing data and making friends with ETL

[Sharing data and making friends with ETL]:(#integrations)

In talking about distributed work with RavenDB so far we have focused primarily on the work that RavenDB is doing to replicate data between different nodes,
in the same cluster as part of the same database group or between different database in potentially different clusters. This mode of operation is simple, 
because you don't just setup the replication and RavenDB will take care of everything else. But there are other modes for distributing data in your systems.

Replication assumes that you have another RavenDB instance and that you want to replicate _everything_ to it. When replicating information, that is what you
want, but we also have a need to share a _part_ of the data. ETL^[Extract, Transform, Load] is the process in which we take data that resides in RavenDB
and push it to an exteranal source, potentionally transforming it along the way. That exteranal source can be another RavenDB instance or a relational database. 

Consider a micro service architecture and the Customer Benefits service. This service decides what kind of benefits the customer has. This can be anything
from free shipping to giving a discount on every 3rd jug of milk and the logic can be as simple as "this customer is in our membership club" to complex as 
trying to compute airline miles. Regardless of how the Customers Benefits service works, it need to let other parts of the system know about the 
benefits that this customer has. The Shipping service, the Helpdesk service and many others need to have that information. 

At the same time, we _really_ don't want them to poke their hands into the Customers Benefits database (or worse, have a shared database for everything).^[Doing
so is a great way to ensure that you'll have all the costs of a micro service architecture with none of the benefits.] We could design an API between the 
systems, but then the Shipping service will be dependent on the Customer Benefits service to always be up. A better solution is to define an ETL process between
the two services and have the Customer Benefits service publish updates for the Shipping service to consume. Those updates are part of the publish contract of
those services, mind. You shouldn't just copy the data between the databases.

Another example is the reporting database, RavenDB is a wonderful database for OTLP scenarios, but for reporting, your organization likely already have a 
solution, and there is really little need to replace that. But you can't just dump the data from RavenDB directly in to a relation database and expect things
to work. We need to transform the data as we send it to match the relational model.

For all of those needs, RavenDB has the notion of ETL processes. Currently RavenDB has builtin ETL to another RavenDB instance and to a relational database 
(such as MS SQL Server, Postgres, Oracle, MySQL, etc). 
Because RavenDB has native relational ETL, brown field systems will typically start using RavenDB by replacing a single component at a time, RavenDB is used
to speed up the behavior of high value targets, but instead of replacing the whole system, we use ETL processes to write the data to the existing relational
database. 

In most cases, the rest of the system doesn't even need to know that some parts are using RavenDB. This is using RavenDB as the write behind cache.
Some part of your application reads and writes to RavenDB directly, and RavenDB will make sure to update the relational system. 
We'll start talking about ETL processes between RavenDB instances, because we explore the whole ETL process without introducing another database instance.


### ETL processes to another RavenDB instance

Any non trivial system is going to have at least a few ETL processes and RavenDB has a good story on how to handle that. The simplest ETL process between
two RavenDB nodes is telling RavenDB that we want to send just a single collection to the other side. Go to `Settings`, `Manage Ongoing Tasks` and click
the `Add Task` button and then select `RavenDB ETL`. You can see how this looks like in Figure 8.1

Add the server URL and the database you want to replicate to, the click on `Add` and add the Companies collection and cick `Save`. RavenDB will now take
over and make sure that any update to a `Companies` document is sent to the other side.

It is _very_ important to remember that ETL is very different from replication. When a RavenDB node perform ETL to another, it is not replicating the data, it 
is _writing_ it. In other words, there are no conflicts and no attempt to handle such. Instead, we'll always overwrite whatever exists on the other side. As far
as the destination node is concerned, the ETL process is just another client writing data to the database. This is done because the data is _not_ the same. 
So far we have only done ETL at the collection level, but we can also modify the data as it is going out. This is the subject for the next section.

#### ETL Scripts

Sometimes you don't want to send a full document in the ETL process. Sometimes you want to filter them or modify their shape. This is quite important for 
since ETL processes compose a part of your public interface

Let us extend the ETL example to filter some of the data. For example, we might want to push all the customers that agreed to take part in a feedback program
