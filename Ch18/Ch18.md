## Operational recipes

This chapter is going to be a short one, mostly consisting of walk throughs of particular tasks that you might need to 
do as part of operating a RavenDB cluster. This isn't meant to replace the online documentation but complement it. 
I tried to cover most of the common scenarios that you might run into in your systems. Beyond using this as a reference
I also suggest going through the various recipes to get some insight about the manner in which such issues are resolved.

Many of the methods listed in this chapter aren't new, we have covered them in previous chapters. Here they are just 
laid out in practical terms as a set of operations to achieve a specific goal.

### Cluster recipes

The cluster is the workhorse that users of RavenDB rarely think about. The cluster is responsible for managing all the 
nodes in the cluster, assign work, monitor the health of the nodes

#### Adding a new node to the cluster

#### Promoting and demoting nodes in the cluster

#### Migrate a node between machines

#### Bring up a cluster from a single surviving node

### Database recipes

#### Reordering nodes and why it matters

#### Moving a database between nodes

#### expanding and shrinking database group

#### Offline query optimization

#### Scaling database under load

#### Disconnect external replication / ETL from a remote source

### Reducing indexing load with priorities

### Controling changes to indexes with locking
